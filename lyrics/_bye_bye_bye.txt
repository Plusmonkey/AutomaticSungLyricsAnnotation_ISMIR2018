Hey, hey!
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye!
Bye, bye!
Oh, oh, oh...

I'm doin' this tonight.
You're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right.

Hey, baby, come on.
I loved you endlessly when you weren't there for me.

So, now it's time to leave and make it alone.
I know that I can't take no more.
It ain't no lie.
I wanna see you out that door.
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Don't wanna be a fool for you, just another player in your game for two.
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye, bye, bye!

Don't really wanna make it tough.
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye, bye, bye!

Just hit me with the truth, now.
Girl, you're more than welcome to.
So, give me one good reason.

Baby, come on.
I live for you and me, and now I really come to see

that life would be much better once you're gone.
I know that I can't take no more.
It ain't no lie.
I wanna see you out that door.
Baby, bye, bye, bye.

Don't wanna be a fool for you, just another player in your game for two.
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye, bye, bye!

Don't really wanna make it tough.
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye, bye, bye!

I'm givin' up.
I know for sure,
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more.
I'm checkin' out.
I'm signin' off.
I don't wanna be the loser, and I've had enough.
I don't wanna be your fool in this game for two.
So I'm leavin' you behind!

I don't want to make it tough, but I've had enough, and it ain't no lie, bye bye!
Don't wanna be a fool for you, just another player in your game for two.
But it ain't no lie.
Baby, bye, bye, bye.

Don't really wanna make it tough.
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie.
Bye, bye, bye!
