There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.

And God, I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor, she sewed my new blue jeans.

My father was a gamblin' man, down in New Orleans.

Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk.

And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.

Oh mother, tell your children not to do what I have done.

Spend your lives in sin and misery, in the house of the Rising Sun.

There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.

And God, I know I'm one.
