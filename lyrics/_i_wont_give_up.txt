When I look into your eyes,
it's like watching the night sky
or a beautiful sunrise.
Well, there's so much they hold.

And just like them old stars,
I see that you've come so far
to be right where you are.
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.

And when you're needing your space
to do some navigating,
I'll be here patiently waiting
to see what you find.

'Cause even the stars, they burn.
Some even fall to the Earth.
We got a lot to learn.
God knows we're worth it.

No, I won't give up.
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily.
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make.
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts we got.
Yeah, we got a lot at stake.
And in the end, you're still my friend.
At least we did intend for us to work.
We didn't break.
we didn't burn.
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in.
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not,
and who I am.

I won't give up on us
even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.
I'm still looking up.

Well, I won't give up on us.
God knows I'm tough enough.
We got a lot to learn.
God knows we're worth it.

I won't give up on us
even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.
