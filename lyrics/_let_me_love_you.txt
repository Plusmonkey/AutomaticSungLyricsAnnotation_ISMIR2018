Mmm, uh.
Mmm, yeah.
Mmm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Mmm, uh.
Mmm, yeah.
Mmm mmm, yea-yeah.

Baby, I just don't get it.
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume,
the makeup on his shirt.

You don't believe his stories,
you know that they're all lies.
Bad as you are, you stick around,
and I just don't know why.

If I was your man,
Baby, you,
never worry 'bout,
what I do.
I'd be comin' home,
back to you, 
every night, doin' you right.

You're the type of woman,
deserves good things,
fistful of diamonds,
handful of rings.
Baby, you're a star,
I just want to show you, you are.

You should let me love you,
let me be the one to,
give you everything you want, and need.

Baby, good love and protection,
make me your selection,
show you the way love's supposed to be.

Baby, you should let me love you,
love you,
love you,
love you, yeah.

Listen, your true beauty's description,
looks so good that it hurts.
You're a dime plus ninety nine,
and it's a shame,
don't even know what you're worth.

Huh.
Everywhere you go they stop and stare,
'cause you're bad, and it shows.
And from your head to your toes,
out of control,

baby, you know.
Baby, you,
never worry 'bout,
what I do.
I'd be comin' home,
back to you,
every night, doin' you right.

You're the type of woman,
deserves good things,
fistful of diamonds,
handful of rings.
Baby, you're a star,
I just want to show you, you are.

You should let me love you.
Let me be the one to
give you everything you want and need.

Well, baby, good love and protection, woah,
make me your selection,
show you the way love's supposed to be.

Baby, you should let me...
Woah, you know you deserve better.
Uh, baby.
With me and you, it's whatever, girl.
Hey.
So, can we make this thing ours?

You should let me love you.
Let me be the one to give... woo!

Everything you need, yeah.
Said, everything.
Will you check me, baby?
Haaaa!

Baby, you should let me love you.
Girl, ah, ah, doin' the thing.
Huh.

That good love and protection.
Hey, hey.

Love you, the one to.

I'm everything you need, woo, baby, protection,
selection, baby.
Oh, yeah.

Let me love you.
That's all you need, baby.
