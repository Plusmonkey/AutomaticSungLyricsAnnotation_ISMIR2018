Head under water,
and they tell me to breath easy for a while.
The breathing gets harder, even I know that.
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
if I'm happy in your hands.
I'm unusually hard to hold onto.
Blank stares at blank pages...
No easy way to say this.
You mean well, but you make this hard on me...
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it,
'cause you need one, you see.
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this.
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay.
If all you have is leavin', I'm gon' need a better reason
to write you a love song today.
Today, yay...
I learned the hard way
that they all say things you wanna hear.
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under.
You and your twisted words,
your help just hurts.
You are not what I thought you were.
Hello to high and dry.
Convince me to please you.
Made me think that I need this, too.
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am.
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you asked for it,
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this.
If you're on your way,
I'm not gonna write you to stay.
If all you have is leavin',
I'm gon' need a better reason
to write you a love song today...
'Cause you asked for it,
'cause you need one,
you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this.
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it,
'cause you need one? You see,
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'cause you tell me it's make or breaking this.
If you're on your way,
I'm not gonna write you to stay.
If your heart is nowhere in it,
I don't want it for a minute.
Babe,  I'll walk the seven seas
when I believe that there's a reason
to write you a love song today!
Today-ay-ay, ay-ay, ay...
