I need another story,
something to get off my chest.
My life is kinda boring,
need something that I can confess.

'Til all my sleeves are stained red,
from all the truth that I've said.
Come by it honestly, I swear,
thought you saw me wink, no,
I've been on the brink, so.

Tell me what you want to hear,
something that will light those ears.
Sick of all the insincere,
so I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
This time,
don't need another perfect line,
don't care if critics ever jump in line,
I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
My God,
amazing how we got this far,
it's like we're chasing all those stars,
who's driving shiny big black cars.

And everyday I see the news, all the problems that we could solve,
and when a situation rises just write it into an album,
send it staight to gold.
But I don't really like my flow, no, so.

Tell me what you want to hear,
something that will light those ears.
Sick of all the insincere,
so I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
This time,
don't need another perfect line,
don't care if critics ever jump in line,
I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
Ooh, ooh.

Got no reason, got no shame,
got no family I can blame.
Just don't let me disappear,
Imma tell you everything.

So, tell me what you want to hear,
something that will light those ears.
Sick of all the insincere,
so I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
This time,
don't need another perfect line,
don't care if critics ever jump in line,
I'm gonna give
all my secrets...

Tell me what you want to hear,
something that will light those ears.
Sick of all the insincere,
so I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
This time,
don't need another perfect line,
don't care if critics ever jump in line,
I'm gonna give

all my secrets away.
All my secrets away.
All my secrets away.
