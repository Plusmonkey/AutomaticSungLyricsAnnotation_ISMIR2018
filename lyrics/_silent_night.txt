Silent night!
Holy night!
All is calm, all is bright.
Round yon virgin, Mother and Child.
Holy Infant, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace!
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Silent night!
Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight!
Glories stream from Heaven afar,
Heav'nly Hosts sing, "Hallelujah!"
Christ, the Savior, is born!
Christ, the Savior, is born.

Silent night!
Holy night!
Son of God, loves pure light!
Radiant beams from Thy Holy Face
with the dawn of redeeming grace.
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth!
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth.

Silent night!
Holy night!
Here at last, healing light.
From the Heavenly Kingdom, sent,
abundant grace for our intent.
Jesus, salvation for all!
Jesus, salvation for all.
