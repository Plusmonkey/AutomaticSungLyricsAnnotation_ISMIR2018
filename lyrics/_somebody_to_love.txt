Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Ooh...

Each morning I get up, I die a little,
can barely stand on my feet.
Take a look in the mirror and cry,
Lord, what you're doin' to me!

I spent all my years in believing you, but I just can't get no relief!

Lord, somebody, oh, somebody!
Can anybody find me

somebody to love?
Yeah.

I work hard every day of my life,
I work till I ache my bones!
At the end... I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own!

I go down on my knees and I start to pray
till the tears run down from my eyes!
Lord,

somebody,
ooooh, somebody?

Can anybody find me somebody to loooooooove?
Every day...
I try and I try and I tryyy
but everybody wants to put me down!
They say I'm goin' crazy!
They say I got a lot of water in my brain!
Oh, I got no common sense, I got nobody left to belieeeeeve!

Oooh, somebody?  Oooh,
anybody find me
soooomebody to looooove?!

Got no feel, I got no rhythm,
I just keep losing my beat.
I'm okay, I'm alright,
I ain't gonna face no defeat!

I just gotta get out of this prison cell!
One day I'm gonna be free, Loooord!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooooh!
Find me, find me, find!
Oooooh, find me, find me somebody to love...
Ooooooooh!
Somebody find me somebody to love!

Ooooooooh, find me somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody to love!
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me...
Oooh, somebody to love!
Oooooooh!

Oh, oh, oh, oh!
