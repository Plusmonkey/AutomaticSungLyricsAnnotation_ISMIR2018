Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know,
that baby, you're the best.

I got my red dress on tonight, dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight.
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style.
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive.

Oh my God, I feel it in the air, telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare.
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere.
Nothin' scares me anymore.

Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know,
that baby, you're the best.

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.

I'm feelin' electric tonight, cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout ninenine.
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side.
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight.

Oh my God, I feel it in the air, telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare.
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere.
Nothin' scares me anymore.

Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know,
that baby, you're the best.

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.

I think I'll miss you forever,
like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky.
Later's better than never,
even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive.
Drive...

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,
oh, oh, oh.

Kiss me hard before you go,
summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know,
that baby, you're the best.

I got that summertime, summertime sadness.
S-S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness.
Got that summertime, summertime sadness,

oh, oh, oh.
